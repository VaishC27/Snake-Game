# Snake-Game
Hi! I am Vaishnavi Choubey
This is my first repositroy containing Code for the evergreen Snake Game. 
A snake game that has, a moving snake, which you control using your keyboard, and you can go and get food, and then it grows in length as it eats more food.
And you have to make sure that you don't end up getting tangled or hitting the wall.
It is created using OOP, Turtle Graphics and Python Programming.
