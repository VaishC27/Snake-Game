# Snake Game

Welcome to the classic **Snake Game**, implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. Guide your snake to eat food, grow longer, and try to achieve the highest score possible. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. This project is a fun way to practice Python and game development concepts.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Food Consumption:** The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the current score and the highest score.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

## How It Works

### Main Script: `The_snake_game.py`

The main script sets up the game window, initializes the snake, food, and scoreboard, and starts the game loop.

### Food Module: `food.py`

This module defines the `Food` class, which handles food creation and random placement on the screen.

### Scoreboard Module: `scoreboard.py`

This module defines the `ScoreBoard` class, which tracks and displays the score and high score.

### Snake Module: `snake.py`

This module defines the `Snake` class, which handles the snake's movement, growth, and collision logic.

## Running the Game

To start the game, run the `The_snake_game.py` file. Ensure you have Python installed along with the Turtle graphics library.


## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the snake's direction.
- Eat the blue food to grow longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
- Aim to achieve the highest score possible.

### Final Note

Get ready to enjoy a blend of nostalgia and challenge. This Snake Game won't make you a Python expert overnight, but it's a fun way to learn and practice coding! Play at your own risk of becoming addicted.
